# Contribution guide

Setup and contribution guidelines for this project.

## Setup
This repository uses _uv_ to manage Python and its dependencies, and _pre-commit_ to run
automatic code linting & formatting.

1. Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

2. Navigate to this project directory

3. Install pre-commit:

```zsh
# We can use uv to install pre-commit!
uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv --force-reinstall

# Check that pre-commit installed alright (should say 3.8.0 or similar)
pre-commit --version

# After installing pre-commit, you'll need to initialise it.
# This installs all pre-commit hooks, the scripts which run before a commit.
pre-commit install

# It's a good idea to run pre-commit now on all files.
pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. Run code:

```zsh
uv run <PATH-TO-PYTHON-FILE>
```

## Pre-commit hooks

I've included a couple of pre-commit hooks 
(see [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml)) which will be executed every 
time we commit code to git. Both pre-commit hooks come from the 
[ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) Python linter:
- `ruff`: lints Python code to ensure it adheres to the PEP8 standards. Includes a bunch of nice things like automatic sorting of imports by name and type.
- `ruff format`: formats Python code in a consistent manner, including removing excess whitespace, swapping tabs for spaces, and a _tonne_ of other things.

These should help to keep code tidy and consistent, with no extra effort on our part. 
Both of the hooks should run automagically if you've followed the setup instructions for
[installing pre-commit with uv](#development---getting-started).
